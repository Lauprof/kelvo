<figcaption style="color:black;">This is Clare his first love after joining the university</figcaption>
<p>As you can see she is a lady to salivate about.She is endowed with sexy thighs that any man would die trying to open them.They dated for more than 1 year till things went south.</p>
<p>She was the first lady she had a serious relationship with.I do actually remember his frequent visits to Thika especially on weekends</p>
<p>On his return you could not fail to see him gliterring,full of joy i must say</p>
<h4>Cost of love in modern world</h4>
<p><i><b>Currently he is very single and comfortable,this is what he says most of the time</b></i></p><hr>
<img src="Screenshot_20220324-183105.png" width="80%" height="auto">
<p style="color:white;">It is clearly visible that love has really frustrated him in all fronts.The cashlessness,phonelessness of ladies in 21st Century is really a turn off to him.</p>
<p style="color:white;">This has led him decide to be single and enjoy building himself instead of chasing someone who adds no value to him</p>
